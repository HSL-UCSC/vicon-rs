Low-level hardware abstraction layer for
reading data from a Vicon motion capture system.

## Using this Crate

The documentation for this crate can be
generated by running `cargo doc`; the 
generated docs will be written to `release/`.

Although the _actual_ Vicon data stream SDK
can only be used with an _actual_ Vicon
data stream, this crate exposes a single 
`HasViconHardware` trait which can be
compiled on any host.

This trait can be used to create mock
implementations of the Vicon data stream,
which systems can use for integration testing
or simulation when an actual Vicon is unavailable.

## Compiling on a Linux Host

Before building this crate, or a Crate 
_depending_ on this crate, you need to:

1. Install Rust.
2. Install Clang.

Once these tools are installed, you can
build this crate by running:

1. `cargo build --release`

To _run_ this crate (or crates depending on it),
you will need to ensure all the `.so` files
in [`vendor/libvicon`](vendor/libvicon/) are
available on your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
